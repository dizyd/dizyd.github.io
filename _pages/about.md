# About 

My name is David Izydorczyk and I am a Ph.D. Student in the Research Training Group Statistical Modeling Psychology (SMiP) in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Mannheim. I love data science, cognitive modeling, and R. From an academic perspective, I work on cognitive models describing quantitiave judgment processes. This website is so far only a fun side activity to learn more about github, css, html and websites in general. Maybe at some day there will even be some real content on it. 


This website and the blogs on it are about: 

- things I learned, to make it simpler for me to do the same thing again next time, 
- things I learned, to make it simpler for other people to learn the same thing quicker,
- things I wanted to (start) learn(ing)
- things I always forget where to look them up
