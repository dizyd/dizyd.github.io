title: "Shiny"

I have developed a number of R shiny apps which I want to link here,  that are available for exploration. Be warned that the apps have limited (i.e. no) documentation or guidance. They were designed to be intuitive, but maybe only in the eyes of the creator. The software provided on this website may be used for non-commercial purposes free of charge.  Although considerable effort was put into developing and testing the software, there is no warranty whatsoever.
