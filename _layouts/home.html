<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is David Izydorczyk and I am a Ph.D.Â Student in the Research Training Group Statistical Modeling Psychology (SMiP) in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Mannheim. I love data science, cognitive modeling, and R. From an academic perspective, I work on cognitive models describing quantitiave judgment processes. This website is so far only a fun side activity to learn more about github, css, html and websites in general. Maybe at some day there will even be some real content on it.</p>
<p>This website and the blogs on it are about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>things I learned, to make it simpler for me to do the same thing again next time,</li>
    <li>things I learned, to make it simpler for other people to learn the same thing quicker,</li>
    <li>things I wanted to (start) learn(ing)</li>
    <li>things I always forget where to look them up</li>
</ul>
