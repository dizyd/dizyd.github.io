My name is David Izydorczyk and I am a Ph.D. Student in the Research Training Group Statistical Modeling Psychology (SMiP) in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Mannheim. This website is so far only a fun side activity to learn more about github, css, html and websites in general. Maybe at some day there will even be some real content on it.
